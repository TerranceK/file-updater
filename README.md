# file-updater

My first little project. Small steps.

Simple program that updates a particular file. Written in PHP (and some HTML). Main point was not in coming up with a fully functional system, but rather in some form of practical learning - concepts like linking PHP and HTML (and a little bit of CSS), reading from and writing to a file, writing code across multiple pages etc.
